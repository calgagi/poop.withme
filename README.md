# poop.withme
HackCU project.

## Initial plan
* As a user, I want to find the closest bathroom to me so that I can use it upon arrival. 
     * On open, display list of bathrooms with maybe user preferences on sorting.

* As a user, I want to be able to click on a bathroom to get the route to the bathroom.
     * Use implicit intent or explicit intent (if we can get it to work) to find route.
